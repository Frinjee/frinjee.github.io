O∆K encourages collaboration among members across the five pillars of leadership celebrated by O∆K: academics and research, athletics, service to campus and community, communications, and creative and performing arts. Founded in 1914 at Washington and Lee University, O∆K honors and develops leaders through scholarships, workshops, career development, leadership resources, and a lifelong connection to other members. The Society also champions its leadership values of collaboration, inclusivity, integrity, scholarship, and service. OΔK has more than 300 circles of record at colleges and universities across the United States. We remain committed to developing campus leaders who will become tomorrow’s community leaders. Two things make the Society unique. First, O∆K encourages collaboration among leaders across campus. We believe that strong leaders become stronger leaders through this fellowship. The second thing that makes the Society unique is that—in addition to undergraduate students—membership is open to faculty, staff, alumni, and graduate students. We believe that a diverse cross-section of the campus community strengthens each circle and allows students to learn from people in different stages of life. (From https://odk.org/about-odk/) UBalt's Circle is opening applications for the Spring 2026 semester January 26 through March 4.
